*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  XERBLA is an error handler for the  BLAS  routines. It is called by a
*  BLAS routine if an input parameter has an invalid value. A message is
*  printed.  Installers  may consider modifying this routine in order to
*  call system-specific exception-handling facilities.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SRNAME  (input)                       CHARACTER*6
*          The name of the routine which called XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (input)                       INTEGER
*          The  position  of the invalid parameter in the parameter list
*          of the calling routine.
