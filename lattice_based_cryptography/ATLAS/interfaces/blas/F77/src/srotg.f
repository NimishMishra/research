*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SROTG  constructs a Givens plane rotation. Given the scalars a and b,
*  this routine computes the following quantities:
*
*     sigma = sgn(a) if |a| > |b|, sgn(b) otherwise;
*     r     = sigma * sqrt( a^2 + b^2 );
*     c     = a / r if r <> 0, 1 otherwise;
*     s     = b / r if r <> 0, 0 otherwise.
*
*  The numbers c, s and r then satisfy the matrix equation:
*
*     [ c  s ] [ a ]    [ r ]
*     [ -s c ] [ b ] =  [ 0 ].
*
*  The introduction of  sigma  is not essential  to the computation of a
*  Givens rotation matrix, but it permits later stable reconstruction of
*  c and s from just one stored number.  For  this purpose, this routine
*  also computes
*
*          s        if |a| > |b|,
*     z =  1 / c    if |b| >= |a| and c <> 0,
*          1        if c = 0.
*
*  This subroutine returns r overwriting a, and z overwriting b, as well
*  as returning c and s. If one later wishes to reconstruct c and s from
*  z, it can be done as follows:
*
*     if  z  = 1,    set c = 0             and s = 1,
*     if |z| < 1,    set c = sqrt(1 - z^2) and s = z,
*     if |z| > 1,    set c = 1 / z         and s = sqrt(1 - c^2).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  A       (input/output)                REAL
*          On entry, A specifies the scalar a. On exit, A is overwritten
*          by the scalar r defined above.
*
*  B       (input/output)                REAL
*          On entry, B specifies the scalar b. On exit, B is overwritten
*          by the scalar z defined above.
*
*  C       (output)                      REAL
*          On exit, C  specifies the scalar c defined above.
*
*  S       (output)                      REAL
*          On exit, S  specifies the scalar s defined above.
