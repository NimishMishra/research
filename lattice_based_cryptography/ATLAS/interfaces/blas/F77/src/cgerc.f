*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      INTEGER            INCX, INCY, LDA, M, N
      COMPLEX            ALPHA
*     ..
*     .. Array Arguments ..
      COMPLEX            A( LDA, * ), X( * ), Y( * )
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CGERC performs the rank 1 operation
*
*     A := alpha*x*conjg( y' ) + A,
*
*  where alpha is a scalar,  x is an m-element vector, y is an n-element
*  vector and A is an m by n matrix.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry,  M  specifies the number of rows of  the matrix  A.
*          M must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N  specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
*          N  must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       COMPLEX
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied as zero then the arrays X and Y need not be set on
*          input. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  X       (input)                       COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( m - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ).  Before entry, the incremen-
*          ted array X must contain the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  INCX    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
*          INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  Y       (input)                       COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  Y  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) ).  Before entry, the incremen-
*          ted array Y must contain the vector y. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  INCY    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
*          INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  A       (input/output)                COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  A  is an array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ). Before en-
*          try, the leading m by n part of the array  A must contain the
*          matrix coefficients. On exit, A is overwritten by the updated
*          matrix.
*
*  LDA     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, LDA  specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*          in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least  max(1,m).
*          Unchanged on exit.
