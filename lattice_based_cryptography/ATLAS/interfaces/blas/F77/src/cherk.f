*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHERK  performs one of the Hermitian rank k operations
*
*     C := alpha * A * conjg( A' ) + beta * C,
*
*  or
*
*     C := alpha * conjg( A' ) * A + beta * C,
*
*  where alpha and beta are  real  scalars, C is an n by n Hermitian ma-
*  trix and  A is an n by k matrix in the first case and a k by n matrix
*  in the second case.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
*          lar part of the array C is to be referenced as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of C
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of C
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  TRANS   (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry,  TRANS  specifies the  operation to be performed as
*          follows:
*
*             TRANS = 'N' or 'n'  C := alpha * A*conjg( A )' + beta * C,
*
*             TRANS = 'C' or 'c'  C := alpha * conjg( A )'*A + beta * C.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix C. N must be at
*          least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  K       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, with TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  K specifies the number of
*          columns of the matrix A, and with TRANS = 'C' or 'c', K  spe-
*          cifies  the  number of rows of the  matrix  A.  K  must be at
*          least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       REAL
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied as zero  then  the  entries of the matrix A need not
*          be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  A       (input)                       COMPLEX array
*          On entry, A is an array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
*          k  when  TRANS = 'N' or 'n', and is n otherwise. Before entry
*          with TRANS = 'N' or 'n', the leading n by k part of the array
*          A must contain the matrix A,  otherwise  the  leading  k by n
*          part of the array A must contain the matrix A.  Unchanged  on
*          exit.
*
*  LDA     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, LDA  specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*          in  the   calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = 'N' or 'n'
*          then  LDA  must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDA must
*          be at least  max( 1, k ). Unchanged on exit.
*
*  BETA    (input)                       REAL
*          On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
*          supplied as zero  then  the  entries of the matrix C need not
*          be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  C       (input/output)                COMPLEX array
*          On entry, C is an array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ). Before entry
*          with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading n by n upper triangular
*          part of the array C must contain the upper triangular part of
*          the  Hermitian matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part
*          of C is not referenced. On exit, the upper triangular part of
*          the array  C  is  overwritten by the upper triangular part of
*          the updated matrix. Before entry with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the
*          leading n by n lower triangular part of the array C must con-
*          tain the lower triangular part of the  Hermitian  matrix  and
*          the strictly upper triangular part of C is not referenced. On
*          exit, the lower triangular part of the array C is overwritten
*          by the lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
*          Note  that  the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements of C
*          need not  be  set,  they are assumed to be zero,  and on exit
*          they are set to zero.
*
*  LDC     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry,  LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
*          in   the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
*          max( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit.
