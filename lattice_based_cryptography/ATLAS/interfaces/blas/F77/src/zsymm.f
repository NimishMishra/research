*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
*
*     C := alpha * A * B + beta * C,
*
*  or
*
*     C := alpha * B * A + beta * C,
*
*  where alpha and beta are scalars,  A is a symmetric matrix and B and
*  C are m by n matrices.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SIDE    (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry,  SIDE  specifies  whether the  symmetric  matrix  A
*          appears  on  the left or right in the operation as follows:
*
*             SIDE = 'L' or 'l'    C := alpha * A * B + beta * C,
*
*             SIDE = 'R' or 'r'    C := alpha * B * A + beta * C.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  UPLO    (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
*          lar part of the array A is to be referenced as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  M       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows of the matrix C.
*          M  must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N  specifies the number of columns of the matrix C.
*          N must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       COMPLEX*16
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied  as  zero  then the elements of the matrices A and B
*          need not be set on input.
*
*  A       (input)                       COMPLEX*16 array
*          On entry, A is an array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
*          m  when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n otherwise.
*          Before  entry  with  SIDE = 'L' or 'l',  the  m by m  part of
*          the  array  A  must contain the  symmetric matrix,  such that
*          when  UPLO = 'U'  or 'u', the leading m by m upper triangular
*          part  of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
*          of the  symmetric  matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
*          part of  A  is not  referenced,  and when  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',
*          the leading  m by m  lower  triangular part  of the  array  A
*          must  contain  the  lower  triangular part  of the  symmetric
*          matrix and the  strictly  upper triangular part of  A  is not
*          referenced.
*          Before  entry  with  SIDE = 'R' or 'r',  the  n by n  part of
*          the  array  A  must contain the  symmetric matrix,  such that
*          when  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the  leading n by n upper triangular
*          part of the array  A  must  contain the upper triangular part
*          of the  symmetric matrix  and the  strictly  lower triangular
*          part of  A  is not  referenced,  and when  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',
*          the leading  n by n  lower  triangular part  of the  array  A
*          must  contain  the  lower  triangular part  of the  symmetric
*          matrix and the  strictly  upper triangular part of  A  is not
*          referenced. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  LDA     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry,  LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*          in the  calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  then
*          LDA  must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
*          least  max( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit.
*
*  B       (input)                       COMPLEX*16 array
*          On entry, B is an array of DIMENSION (LDB, n).  Before entry,
*          the  leading  m by n  part of  the array  B  must contain the
*          matrix B. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  LDB     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, LDB specifies  the first dimension of B as declared
*          in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be   at  least
*          max( 1, m ). Unchanged on exit.
*
*  BETA    (input)                       COMPLEX*16
*          On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
*          supplied  as  zero  then  the  elements of the matrix C  need
*          not be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  C       (input/output)                COMPLEX*16 array
*          On entry, C is an array of DIMENSION (LDC, n).  Before entry,
*          the leading  m by n  part of the array C must contain the ma-
*          trix C, except when beta is zero, in which case C need not be
*          set on entry. On exit, the array C is overwritten by the m by
*          n updated matrix.
*
*  LDC     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry,  LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
*          in   the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
*          max( 1, m ). Unchanged on exit.
