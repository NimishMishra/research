*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CSCAL performs the following operation:
*
*     x := alpha * x,
*
*  where alpha is a scalar and x is an n-vector.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N specifies the length of the vector x. N  must  be
*          at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       COMPLEX
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied as zero, then the entries of the incremented array X
*          need not be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  X       (input/output)                COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) )  that  contains the vector x.
*          On exit, the entries of the incremented array X are mutiplied
*          by alpha.
*
*  INCX    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
*          INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
