*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      CHARACTER*1        UPLO
      INTEGER            INCX, LDA, N
      DOUBLE PRECISION   ALPHA
*     ..
*     .. Array Arguments ..

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYR performs the symmetric rank 1 operation
*
*     A := alpha*x*x' + A,
*
*  where  alpha is a scalar, x is an n-element vector and A is an n by n
*  symmetric matrix.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
*          lar part of the array A is to be referenced as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
*                                  is to be referenced.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at
*          least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       DOUBLE PRECISION
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied as  zero then  the array X need not be set on input.
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  X       (input)                       DOUBLE PRECISION array
*          On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ).  Before entry, the incremen-
*          ted array X must contain the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  INCX    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
*          INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  A       (input/output)                DOUBLE PRECISION array
*          On entry,  A  is an array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ). Before en-
*          try with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the  leading n by n upper trian-
*          gular part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular
*          part of the symmetric matrix and the  strictly lower triangu-
*          lar part of  A is not referenced. On exit, the upper triangu-
*          lar part of the array  A is overwritten by the upper triangu-
*          lar part of the updated matrix.  Before entry with UPLO = 'L'
*          or 'l', the leading n by n lower triangular part of the array
*          A  must  contain the lower triangular  part  of the symmetric
*          matrix  and  the  strictly  upper triangular part of A is not
*          referenced.
*
*  LDA     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, LDA  specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*          in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least  max(1,n).
*          Unchanged on exit.
