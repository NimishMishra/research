*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CHBMV performs the matrix-vector operation
*
*     y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,
*
*  where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n-element vectors and A
*  is an n by n Hermitian band matrix, with k super-diagonals.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input)                       CHARACTER*1
*          On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
*          lar part of the band matrix A is being supplied as follows:
*
*              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is
*                                  being supplied.
*
*              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is
*                                  being supplied.
*
*          Unchanged on exit.
*
*  N       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at
*          least zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  K       (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, K  specifies  the number of  super-diagonals of the
*          matrix A. K must satisfy 0 .le. K. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  ALPHA   (input)                       COMPLEX
*          On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
*          supplied as zero then  A and X  need not be set on input. Un-
*          changed on exit.
*
*  A       (input)                       COMPLEX array
*          On entry, A is an array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ). Before entry
*          with UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading (k + 1) by n part of the
*          array  A  must  contain the upper triangular band part of the
*          Hermitian matrix, supplied column by column, with the leading
*          diagonal of the matrix in row (k + 1) of the array, the first
*          super-diagonal  starting at position 2 in row k,  and  so on.
*          The  top left k by k  triangle of the array A is not referen-
*          ced.  The following program  segment  will transfer the upper
*          triangular part of a Hermitian band  matrix from conventional
*          full matrix storage to band storage:
*
*                DO 20, J = 1, N
*                   M = K + 1 - J
*                   DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - K ), J
*                      A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
*             10    CONTINUE
*             20 CONTINUE
*
*          Before entry with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading (k+1)  by n
*          part of  the array A must contain the lower  triangular  band
*          part of the Hermitian matrix, supplied column by column, with
*          the leading diagonal of the matrix in row 1 of the array, the
*          first sub-diagonal starting at position  1  in row  2, and so
*          on.  The bottom right  k by k  triangle of the array A is not
*          referenced.  The  following program segment will transfer the
*          lower triangular part of a Hermitian band matrix from conven-
*          tional full matrix storage to band storage:
*
*                DO 20, J = 1, N
*                   M = 1 - J
*                   DO 10, I = J, MIN( N, J + K )
*                      A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
*             10    CONTINUE
*             20 CONTINUE
*
*          Note that the  imaginary parts  of the local entries  corres-
*          ponding to the diagonal elements of A need not be set and as-
*          sumed to be zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  LDA     (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, LDA  specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*          in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least k + 1. Un-
*          changed on exit.
*
*  X       (input)                       COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ).  Before entry, the incremen-
*          ted array X must contain the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  INCX    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
*          INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
*
*  BETA    (input)                       COMPLEX
*          On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
*          supplied as zero then Y  need not be set on input.  Unchanged
*          on exit.
*
*  Y       (input/output)                COMPLEX array
*          On entry,  Y  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
*          ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) ).  Before entry with BETA non-
*          zero, the incremented array  Y  must contain the vector y. On
*          exit, Y is overwritten by the updated vector y.
*
*  INCY    (input)                       INTEGER
*          On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
*          INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
