/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_F77wrap_hpr performs the Hermitian rank 1 operation
 *
 *    A := alpha * x * conjg( x' ) + A,
 *
 *
 * Notes
 * =====
 *
 * This routine is an internal wrapper function written in  C  called by
 * the corresponding Fortran 77 user callable subroutine.  It calls  the
 * appropriate ATLAS routine performing the actual computation.
 *
 * This wrapper layer resolves the following portability issues:
 *
 *    - the routines' name sheme translation imposed by the  Fortran / C
 *      compilers of your target computer,
 *    - the translation of Fortran characters into the ATLAS  correspon-
 *      ding C enumerated type (in cooperation with the Fortan user cal-
 *      lable subroutine),
 *    - the translation of Fortran integers into the proper C correspon-
 *      ding native type;
 *
 * and the following ease-of-programming issue:
 *
 *    - a pointer to the the first entry of vector operands (when appli-
 *      cable) is passed to the  ATLAS computational routine even if the
 *      corresponding input increment value is negative. This allows for
 *      a more natural expression in  C  of the computation performed by
 *      these ATLAS functions.
