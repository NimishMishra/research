 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, spr ) performs the symmetric rank 1 operation
 *
 *    A := alpha * x * x' + A,
 *
 * where  alpha is a scalar, x is an n-element vector and A is an n by n
 * symmetric matrix, supplied in packed form.
 *
 * This is a blocked version of the algorithm.  For a more detailed des-
 * cription of  the arguments of this function, see the reference imple-
 * mentation in the ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
