/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_crefhemm  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
 *
 *    C := alpha * A * B + beta * C,
 *
 * or
 *
 *    C := alpha * B * A + beta * C,
 *
 * where alpha and beta are scalars,  A is a Hermitian matrix and B and
 * C are m by n matrices.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * SIDE    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_SIDE
 *         On entry,  SIDE  specifies  whether the  Hermitian  matrix  A
 *         appears  on  the left or right in the operation as follows:
 *
 *            SIDE = AtlasLeft     C := alpha * A * B + beta * C,
 *
 *            SIDE = AtlasRight    C := alpha * B * A + beta * C.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * UPLO    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_UPLO
 *         On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
 *         lar part of the array A is to be referenced as follows:
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasUpper   Only the upper triangular part of A
 *                                 is to be referenced.
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasLower   Only the lower triangular part of A
 *                                 is to be referenced.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * M       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows of the matrix C.
 *         M  must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N  specifies the number of columns of the matrix C.
 *         N must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * ALPHA   (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
 *         supplied  as  zero  then the elements of the matrices A and B
 *         need not be set on input.
 *
 * A       (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDA * ka * sizeof( float [2] ),  where ka  is  m  when
 *         SIDE = AtlasLeft   and is  n  otherwise.  Before  entry  with
 *         SIDE = AtlasLeft, the  m by m  part of the  array A must con-
 *         tain the Hermitian matrix, such that when  UPLO = AtlasUpper,
 *         the leading m by m upper triangular part of the array A  must
 *         contain the upper triangular part of the Hermitian matrix and
 *         the  strictly lower triangular part of  A  is not referenced,
 *         and when  UPLO = AtlasLower, the  leading m by m lower trian-
 *         gular part of the array A must contain the  lower  triangular
 *         part of the Hermitian matrix and the  strictly upper triangu-
 *         lar part of  A  is not referenced.
 *         Before  entry  with  SIDE = AtlasRight,  the  n by n  part of
 *         the  array  A  must contain the  Hermitian matrix,  such that
 *         when  UPLO = AtlasUpper, the  leading n by n upper triangular
 *         part of the array  A  must  contain the upper triangular part
 *         of the  Hermitian matrix  and the  strictly  lower triangular
 *         part of  A  is not  referenced,  and when  UPLO = AtlasLower,
 *         the leading  n by n  lower  triangular part  of the  array  A
 *         must  contain  the  lower  triangular part  of the  Hermitian
 *         matrix and the  strictly  upper triangular part of  A  is not
 *         referenced.
 *         Note that the imaginary parts of the local entries correspon-
 *         ding to the diagonal  elements of A need not be set and assu-
 *         med to be zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * LDA     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDA  specifies the leading dimension of A as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDA  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, m ) when SIDE = AtlasLeft, and MAX( 1, n ) otherwise.
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * B       (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry,  B  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDB * n * sizeof( float [2] ).  Before entry, the lea-
 *         ding m by n  part of the array  B  must contain the matrix B.
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * LDB     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDB  specifies the leading dimension of B as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDB  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, m ). wise. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * BETA    (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
 *         supplied  as  zero  then  the  elements of the matrix C  need
 *         not be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * C       (input/output)                float *
 *         On entry,  C  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDC * n * sizeof( float [2] ).  Before entry, the lea-
 *         ding m by n part of the array  C  must contain the matrix  C,
 *         except when beta is zero,  in which case C need not be set on
 *         entry.  On exit, the array C is overwritten by the m by n up-
 *         dated matrix.
 *
 * LDC     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDC  specifies the leading dimension of A as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDC  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, m ). Unchanged on exit.
