/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_dreftrmm  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
 *
 *    B := alpha * op( A ) * B,   or    B := alpha * B * op( A ),
 *
 * where alpha is a scalar, B is an m by n matrix, A is a unit,  or non-
 * unit, upper or lower triangular matrix and op( X ) is one of
 *
 *    op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X'.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * SIDE    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_SIDE
 *         On entry,  SIDE  specifies whether  op( A ) multiplies B from
 *         the left or right as follows:
 *
 *            SIDE = AtlasLeft   B := alpha * op( A )* B,
 *
 *            SIDE = AtlasRight  B := alpha * B * op( A ).
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * UPLO    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_UPLO
 *         On entry, UPLO  specifies whether  the  matrix is an upper or
 *         lower triangular matrix as follows:
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasUpper   A is an upper triangular matrix.
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasLower   A is a lower triangular matrix.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * TRANSA  (input)                       const enum ATLAS_TRANS
 *         On entry, TRANSA  specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
 *         the matrix multiplication as follows:
 *
 *            TRANSA = AtlasNoTrans    op( A ) = A,
 *
 *            TRANSA = AtlasTrans      op( A ) = A',
 *
 *            TRANSA = AtlasConjTrans  op( A ) = A'.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * DIAG    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_DIAG
 *         On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangu-
 *         lar as follows:
 *
 *            DIAG = AtlasUnit       A is assumed to be unit triangular,
 *
 *            DIAG = AtlasNonUnit    A is not assumed to be unit trian-
 *                                   gular.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * M       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies the number of rows of  the  matrix B.
 *         M  must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N  specifies the number of columns of the matrix B.
 *         N  must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * ALPHA   (input)                       const double
 *         On entry,  ALPHA  specifies  the scalar  alpha. When ALPHA is
 *         supplied as zero then the elements of the matrix B need   not
 *         be set on input. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * A       (input)                       const double *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDA * k * sizeof(   double  ),   where  k  is  m  when
 *         SIDE = AtlasLeft  and  is  n  otherwise.  Before  entry  with
 *         UPLO = AtlasUpper,  the  leading k by k upper triangular part
 *         of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular matrix and
 *         the  strictly lower triangular part of  A  is not referenced.
 *         Before entry with UPLO = AtlasLower, the leading k by k lower
 *         triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower trian-
 *         gular  matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of  A is
 *         not referenced.
 *         Note  that when  DIAG = AtlasUnit,   the diagonal elements of
 *         A  are  not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * LDA     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDA  specifies the leading dimension of A as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDA  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, m ) when SIDE = AtlasLeft, and MAX( 1, n ) otherwise.
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * B       (input/output)                double *
 *         On entry,  B  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDB * n * sizeof(   double  ).  Before entry, the lea-
 *         ding  m by n  part of the array B must contain the matrix  B,
 *         except when beta is zero,  in which case B need not be set on
 *         entry.  On exit, the array B is overwritten by the m by n up-
 *         dated matrix.
 *
 * LDB     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDB  specifies the leading dimension of B as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDB  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, m ). Unchanged on exit.
