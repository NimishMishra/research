/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_sreftrmv performs one of the matrix-vector operations
 *
 *    x := A * x,   or   x := A'*x,
 *
 * where x is an n-element vector and  A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
 * upper or lower triangular matrix.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * UPLO    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_UPLO
 *         On entry, UPLO  specifies whether  the  matrix is an upper or
 *         lower triangular matrix as follows:
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasUpper   A is an upper triangular matrix.
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasLower   A is a lower triangular matrix.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * TRANS   (input)                       const enum ATLAS_TRANS
 *         On entry,  TRANS  specifies the  operation to be performed as
 *         follows:
 *
 *            TRANS = AtlasNoTrans     x := A *x,
 *
 *            TRANS = AtlasConj        x := A *x,
 *
 *            TRANS = AtlasTrans       x := A'*x,
 *
 *            TRANS = AtlasConjTrans   x := A'*x.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * DIAG    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_DIAG
 *         On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangu-
 *         lar as follows:
 *
 *            DIAG = AtlasUnit       A is assumed to be unit triangular,
 *
 *            DIAG = AtlasNonUnit    A is not assumed to be unit trian-
 *                                   gular.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at
 *         least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * A       (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDA * n * sizeof(   float   ).   Before   entry   with
 *         UPLO = AtlasUpper, the leading  n by n  upper triangular part
 *         of the array  A must contain the upper triangular  matrix and
 *         the strictly lower triangular part of  A  is  not referenced.
 *         Before entry with UPLO = AtlasLower, the leading n by n lower
 *         triangular  part of the array A must contain the lower trian-
 *         gular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part  of A is
 *         not referenced. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 *         Note that when  DIAG = AtlasUnit,  the diagonal elements of A
 *         are not referenced  either,  but are assumed to be unity.
 *
 * LDA     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDA  specifies the leading dimension of A as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDA  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * X       (input/output)                float *
 *         On entry,  X  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ) * sizeof(   float   ),
 *         that contains the vector x.  On exit,  X  is overwritten with
 *         the tranformed vector x.
 *
 * INCX    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
