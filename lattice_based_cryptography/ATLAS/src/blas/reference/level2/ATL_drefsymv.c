/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_drefsymv performs the matrix-vector operation
 *
 *    y := alpha * A * x + beta * y,
 *
 * where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n-element vectors and A
 * is an n by n symmetric matrix.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * UPLO    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_UPLO
 *         On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
 *         lar part of the array A is to be referenced as follows:
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasUpper   Only the upper triangular part of A
 *                                 is to be referenced.
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasLower   Only the lower triangular part of A
 *                                 is to be referenced.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at
 *         least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * ALPHA   (input)                       const double
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
 *         supplied as zero then  A and X  need not be set on input. Un-
 *         changed on exit.
 *
 * A       (input)                       const double *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   LDA * n * sizeof(   double  ).   Before   entry   with
 *         UPLO = AtlasUpper, the leading  n by n  upper triangular part
 *         of the array  A must contain the upper triangular part of the
 *         symmetric matrix  and  the strictly  lower triangular part of
 *         A is not referenced. Before entry with UPLO = AtlasLower, the
 *         leading  n by n  lower  triangular part of the array  A  must
 *         contain the lower triangular part of the symmetric matrix and
 *         the  strictly upper triangular part of  A  is not referenced.
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * LDA     (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, LDA  specifies the leading dimension of A as decla-
 *         red  in  the  calling  (sub) program.  LDA  must be  at least
 *         MAX( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * X       (input)                       const double *
 *         On entry,  X  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ) * sizeof(   double  ),
 *         that contains the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * INCX    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * BETA    (input)                       const double
 *         On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
 *         supplied as zero then Y  need not be set on input.  Unchanged
 *         on exit.
 *
 * Y       (input/output)                double *
 *         On entry,  Y  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) ) * sizeof(   double  ),
 *         that contains the vector y.  Before entry with BETA non-zero,
 *         the incremented array  Y  must contain the vector y. On exit,
 *         Y is overwritten by the updated vector y.
 *
 * INCY    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
 *         INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
