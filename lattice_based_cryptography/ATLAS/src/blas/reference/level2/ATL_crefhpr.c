/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_crefhpr performs the Hermitian rank 1 operation
 *
 *    A := alpha* x * conjg( x' ) + A,
 *
 * where  alpha is a real scalar, x is an n-element vector and A is an n
 * by n Hermitian matrix, supplied in packed form.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * UPLO    (input)                       const enum ATLAS_UPLO
 *         On entry, UPLO  specifies whether the upper or lower triangu-
 *         lar part of the matrix A is supplied in the packed array A
 *         as follows:
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasUpper   The upper triangular part of A is
 *                                 supplied in A.
 *
 *             UPLO = AtlasLower   The lower triangular part of A is
 *                                 supplied in A.
 *
 *         Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at
 *         least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * ALPHA   (input)                       const float
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the real scalar alpha.  When  ALPHA
 *         is supplied as  zero then  the array X need not be set on in-
 *         put. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * X       (input)                       const float *
 *         On entry,  X  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ) * sizeof( float [2] ),
 *         that contains the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * INCX    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * A       (input/output)                float *
 *         On entry,  A  points  to an array of size equal to or greater
 *         than   (( n*(n+1) ) / 2) * sizeof( float [2] ). Before  entry
 *         with UPLO = AtlasUpper, the array  A  must  contain the upper
 *         triangular part of the Hermitian matrix packed  sequentially,
 *         column  by  column,  so that A[0] contains a(0,0), A[ 1 ] and
 *         A[ 2 ] contain a(0,1) and a(1,1) respectively, and  so on. On
 *         exit, the array A is overwritten by the upper triangular part
 *         of the updated matrix.  Before entry with  UPLO = AtlasLower,
 *         the  array  A  must contain  the lower triangular part of the
 *         Hermitian matrix  packed sequentially, column by  column,  so
 *         that A[ 0 ] contains a(0,0), A[ 1 ] and A[ 2 ] contain a(1,0)
 *         and a(2,0) respectively, and so on. On exit, the array  A  is
 *         overwritten by  the  lower triangular part of the updated ma-
 *         trix.
 *         Note that the imaginary parts of the  diagonal elements  need
 *         not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they are
 *         set to zero.
