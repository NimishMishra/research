 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_zrefcopy copies the entries of an n-vector x into an n-vector y.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * N       (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the length of the vector x. N  must  be
 *         at least zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * X       (input)                       const double *
 *         On entry,  X  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) ) * sizeof( double[2] ),
 *         that contains the vector x. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * INCX    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * Y       (input/output)                double *
 *         On entry,  Y  points to the  first entry to be accessed of an
 *         incremented array of size equal to or greater than
 *            ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCY ) ) * sizeof( double[2] ),
 *         that contains the vector y.  On exit,  the entries of the in-
 *         cremented array  X are  copied into the entries of the incre-
 *         mented array  Y.
 *
 * INCY    (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y.
 *         INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
