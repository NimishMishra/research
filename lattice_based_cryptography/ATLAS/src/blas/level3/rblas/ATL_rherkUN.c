 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_rherkUN performs the following Hermitian rank-k operation
 *
 *    C := alpha * A * conjg( A' ) + beta * C,
 *
 * where alpha and beta are real scalars,  C is an n by n (upper) Hermi-
 * tian matrix and  A is an n by k matrix.
 *
 * This is a type-less recursive version of the algorithm.
