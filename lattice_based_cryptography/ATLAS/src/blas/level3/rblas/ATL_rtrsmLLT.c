 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_rtrsmLLT solves the matrix equation
 *
 *    A' * X = alpha * B,
 *
 * where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices, A is a unit, or
 * non-unit, lower triangular matrix. The matrix X is overwritten on B.
 *
 * This is a type-less recursive version of the algorithm.
