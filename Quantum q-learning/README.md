# Exploratory project on determining performance of Q-learning in non-markovian environments

Uses the non-deterministic setup from my [previous work](https://github.com/NimishMishra/research/tree/master/Degrees%20of%20freedom) to investigate performance of Q-learning agents in non-markovian environements. Results have been exciting but nothing novel yet to document in an article. 

(Includes Qiskit code)
