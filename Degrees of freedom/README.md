# Adding degrees of freedom to automated quantum Braitenberg vehicles
Builds upon the [previous] (https://github.com/NimishMishra/research/tree/master/Automation%20of%20quantum%20robots) work and relates similarities between classical and quantum logic (as applicable to quantum robots). Claims that arbitrary degrees of freedom may be added to such robots. Presents algorithms to concretely instantiate such additions.
