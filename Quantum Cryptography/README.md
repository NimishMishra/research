# Quantum inspired digital signature scheme

Inspired from Bachelor's project on [lattice based crytography](https://github.com/NimishMishra/research/tree/master/Lattice%20based%20cryptography), special combination of digital signature schemes and ideas in [quantum robots](https://github.com/NimishMishra/research/tree/master/Degrees%20of%20freedom) lead to experiments in Qiskit on quantum digital signature schemes.

(Currently writing the first draft of the manuscript)

(Includes Qiskit code)
